OpenSlide Basic Definition and functions:

1. level_count : The number of levels in the slide. Levels are numbered from 0
		 (highest resolution to the level_count -1 (the lowest resolution).

2. dimension: A( width, height) tuple for level 0 of the slide

3. level_dimensions: A list of (width, height) tuples, one for each level of the 
	             slide. level_dimensions[k] are the dimensions of level k.

4. level_downsamples: A list of downsample factors for each level of the slide.
	 	      level_downsamples[k] is the downsample factor of level k.

5. read_region(location, level, size): Return an RGBA Image containing the contents
		     of the specified region.
		     
!!!!
6. OpenSlide image colorspace is RGBA
--- to use OpenSlide output in QImage, need to transfer OpenSlide format from 
--- RGBA to ARGB32 

7. numpy.require : return ndarray of the provided type that satisfies requirements
